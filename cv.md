# Research Interests
Numerical Linear Algebra

Effects of data representation on performance and accuracy

High performance computing

# Education

Ph.D. student in Computer Science, University of Tennessee,
* Advised by Dr. Jack Dongarra

B.A. *magna cum laude* in Math and Computer Science, Saint John's University, 2019

* Advised by Dr. Mike Heroux
* Thesis: [Reducing Memory Access Latencies using Data Compression in Sparse, Iterative Linear Solvers](https://github.com/neil-lindquist/Undergrad-Thesis/blob/master/thesis.pdf)

# Research Experience

Givens Associate - Argonne National Laboratory (May 2021 through August 2021)
 * Porting interpolation routines to GPU accelerators using the [OCCA](https://libocca.org) runtime in [NekRS](https://github.com/Nek5000/nekRS), a spectral-element based fluid dynamics code.

Graduate Research Assistant - University of Tennessee (July 2019 through the present)
 * Experimenting with use of a mix of double and single floating point precision in GMRES, a sparse, iterative linear solver.
 * Experimenting with using Random Butterfly Transforms to replace pivoting in LU factorization for [SLATE](http://icl.utk.edu/slate/), a distributed, GPU-accelerated, dense linear algebra library.
 * Contributed to a machine learning based workflow for classification of protein structural properties from XFEL diffraction patterns.

Research Assistant - Saint John's University (May 2017 through May 2019)
 * Explored the use of data compression to improve the performance of Conjugate Gradient, a sparse, iterative linear solver.
 * Tested the effect on performance of using Julia, a high level programming language, to implement distributed, sparse linear algebra codes.
