I recently graduated with a B.A. degree in  Math and Computer Science at [Saint John's University](https://www.csbsju.edu/).
As a member of the [Collegeville](http://github.com/Collegeville) research group, I did research involving high performance, sparse linear algebra.

This fall, I will join the High Performance Computing PhD program at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville.
In particular, I am joining the Innovative Computing Laboratory and the Global Computing Laboratory, I aim to continue doing research in a similar field to my previous work.

My hobbies include programming, rowing and board games.
My hobby programming spans a variety of small projects, primarily involving Common Lisp.
The most notable of these projects is the [SLIMA plugin for Atom](https://atom.io/packages/slima), which enables interactive Common Lisp development in Atom.
