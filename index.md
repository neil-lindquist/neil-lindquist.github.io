I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville and a graduate research assistant in Dr. Jack Dongarra's Innovative Computing Laboratory.
My research interests include using multiple floating point precisions, and other data compression, to improve the performance of sparse linear algebra codes.

I earned my B.A. degree in  Math and Computer Science at [Saint John's University](https://www.csbsju.edu/) in Minnesota.
As a member of the [Collegeville](http://github.com/Collegeville) research group, I did research in high performance sparse linear algebra, which lead to my current position.

My hobbies include programming, rowing and board games.
My hobby programming spans a variety of small projects, primarily involving Common Lisp.
The most notable of these projects is the [SLIMA plugin for Atom](https://atom.io/packages/slima), which enables interactive Common Lisp development in Atom.
