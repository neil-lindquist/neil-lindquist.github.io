I am a Developer Technology Engineer at NVIDIA.
My professional interests include in high performance computing, numerical linear algebra, and approximate computing algorithms.
I am currently involved in several projects, including the [cuSolverDx library](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cusolverdx/) which provides linear algebra solvers for CUDA kernels.
Previously, I was at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, where I earned by Ph.D. under Jack Dongarra.
My graduate work was largely focused on developing new techniques to avoid communication in dense LU and GMRES in order to improve the performance on modern supercomputers.
