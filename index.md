I am an undergraduate Math and Computer Science major at [Saint John's University](https://www.csbsju.edu/).
As a member of the [Collegeville](http://github.com/Collegeville) research group, I do research involving high performance, sparse linear algebra.

This fall, I will join the High Performance Computing PhD program at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville.  There I aim to continue doing research in a similar field to my current work.

My hobbies include programming, rowing and board games.
My hobby programming spans a variety of small projects, primarily in Common Lisp.
