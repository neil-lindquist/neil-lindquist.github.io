I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville.
I am a research assistant at both Dr. Jack Dongarra's Innovative Computing Laboratory and Dr. Michela Taufer's Global Computing Laboratory.
In this role, my research involves high performance sparse linear algebra.

I earned my B.A. degree in  Math and Computer Science at [Saint John's University](https://www.csbsju.edu/) in Minnesota.
As a member of the [Collegeville](http://github.com/Collegeville) research group, I did research in high performance sparse linear algebra, which lead to my current position.

My hobbies include programming, rowing and board games.
My hobby programming spans a variety of small projects, primarily involving Common Lisp.
The most notable of these projects is the [SLIMA plugin for Atom](https://atom.io/packages/slima), which enables interactive Common Lisp development in Atom.
