I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville and a graduate research assistant in Dr. Jack Dongarra's Innovative Computing Laboratory.
My research interests include numerical linear algebra, approximate computing algorithms, and high performance computing.

I earned my B.A. degree in  Math and Computer Science at [Saint John's University](https://www.csbsju.edu/) in Minnesota.
As a member of the [Collegeville](http://github.com/Collegeville) research group, I did research in high performance sparse linear algebra, including exploring the use of mixed precision and testing the Julia programing language in an distributed context.

My hobbies include programming, rowing and board games.
My hobby programming spans a variety of small projects, primarily involving Common Lisp.
The most notable of these projects is the [SLIMA plugin for Pulsar](https://web.pulsar-edit.dev/packages/slima), which enables interactive Common Lisp development in Pulsar.
