I am an undergraduate Math and Computer Science major at [Saint John's University](https://www.csbsju.edu/).
As a member of the [Collegeville](http://github.com/Collegeville) research group, I do research involving high performance, sparse linear algebra.
Currently, I am applying to PhD programs to do continue doing research in the same or a related topic.

My hobbies include programming, rowing and board games.
My hobby programming spans a variety of small projects, primarily in Common Lisp.
