## JuliaPetra
##### July 2017 - Present
An implementation of Trilinos's Petra Object Model in Julia.
The project is trying to understand how well Julia works for distributed, high performance computing.

* [JuliaPetra.jl](github.com/collegeville/JuliaPetra.jl) - The implementation, submitted for addition to the official package registry
* [Obtaining Performance from a Julia-Implementation of Trilinos Data Librairies](https://www.pathlms.com/siam/courses/10878/sections/14368/video_presentations/127457) - presented at the 2019 SIAM Conference on Computational Science and Engineering
* JuliaPetra: An Implementation of the Petra Object Model in Julia - writing with [Dr. Mike Heroux](https://maherou.github.io/)
* [TypeStability.jl](github.com/collegeville/typestability.jl) - A Julia package to automate type stability checks

## Reducing Memory Access Latencies using Data Compression in Sparse, Iterative Linear Solvers
##### May 2017 - Present
Determining whether the performance of sparse linear solvers can be improved by reducing memory access latencies using data compression.
This project is being written up as my undergraduate thesis.
